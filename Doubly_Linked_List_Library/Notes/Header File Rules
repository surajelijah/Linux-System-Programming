-   Header File contains :
        - Anything which needs to be exposed to other source files
            - Structure definitions
            - Constants and Enumerations
            - Macros
            - Function Declarations (No Function Definitions)
            - static inline functions (these do have definitions if you want)


- Header files must be included in order to use them in any source file
  and the related source file that has the definitions of the header file must be linked to the source code
  that uses the header file


- Header files actually says -
    - Hey developer that here developer, I have the declaration of all these functions whose definitions is defined in some other source file, use them using the prototype or
signatures that I am telling you. And yes, do not dare to see the internal implementation of these functions in source files. Also do link the the source file that contains these defintions 
to the object file that uses this header file

-A header file conveys that what is there to be used by you and you should not bother how it is done.
