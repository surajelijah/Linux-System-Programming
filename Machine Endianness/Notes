- https://developer.ibm.com/articles/au-endianc/ - This has information about why Machine Endianness is needed

- Big Endian - Network Byte Order - Higher Byte is stored in Lower Address

- Little Endian - Host Byte Order - Higher Byte is stored in Higher Address


- Endianness is the order of how bytes are stored in memory but bits in each byte are in order
