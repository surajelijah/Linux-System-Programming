
- Now before the compiler compiles the source files, the preprocessor does the text substitution
- The C Preprocessor directives is simply a text substitution tool


- Remember the Text Subsitution is performed before the compiler actually starts compilation of the source files
    - Compilation starts on Translation Units
    - Transalation Units are source files (.c files) after Preprocessor does Text Subsitution on them


- Directives can be present in both the header files and the source files

- The preprocessor performs preliminary operations on C and C++ files before they are passed to the compiler. 
  You can use the preprocessor to conditionally compile code, insert files, specify compile-time error messages, 
  and apply machine-specific rules to sections of code


- #define 
- #include
- #undef
- #ifdef - Returns true if the macro is defined
- #ifndef - Reurns true if the macro is not defined
- #if
- #else
- #elif
- #endif 


- #a - "a"
- a##b - ab
