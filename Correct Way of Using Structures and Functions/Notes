- Rules for Defining and Using the Structures and Functions

    - Structures
        - Always defines the structures and then use it 
        - If there are any nested structures then define the nested structures then use them in other structures
        - Define the independant structures then the dependant structures

    - Functions
        - Always declare the function and then use it
        - Compiler do not consider the function definition while compiling the source files ( creating Objects )
        - Functions definition must be present in one source file which should be linked to create an executable
